The following repository contains some of my homework for course ANDROID.

## [Homework 1](https://github.com/amirmohammadraei/android-playground/tree/main/HW1)

In this exercise, we had to write a simple program that would show a small ID card of us on the screen. In this application, we had to display a small picture of ourselves on the right side of the screen, and our first and last name on the left side, and the email at the bottom of the screen.

## [Homework 2](https://github.com/amirmohammadraei/android-playground/tree/main/HW2)

The purpose of this exercise was to make a simple fortune telling program. In this program, when entering, there is an option at the bottom of the screen to get a horoscope. By pressing it, one of Hafez's poems entered in the program is randomly selected and displayed to the user. The user can get another fortune by pressing that button again.

For this program, we had to have at least 5 different poems of Hafez in the program and show one of them randomly.

Also, next to the fortune telling button, there should have been another button called "About the program", which would have provided general information about the program, such as the version number and its author.

Details such as what information or guidance should be displayed on the page at the beginning of entering the program were left to us.

We had to design a theme for the whole program so that our program would have a different state from other programs.

Also, we had to choose (or design) a charming icon for our program and place it.

## [Homework 3](https://github.com/amirmohammadraei/android-playground/tree/main/HW3)


In this exercise, we created the book display part of a book reader system. On the first page, we used to display a list of books. This included the book cover image, book title, and author name. For this page, the user could see the list in the form of a list where the books are displayed below each other, or if there are 3 books next to each other in each row. The user could click on the book image to see more information about the book. In this case, another page should have been displayed, in which the image of the book was first displayed, and below that information related to the book, such as the author, publisher, year of publication, edition, summary, etc., was displayed.

For this project, we had to program and display the information of at least 5 books.

## [Homework 4](https://github.com/amirmohammadraei/android-playground/tree/main/HW4)

We had to design a currency conversion app that would allow the user to easily convert money between different currencies. In this application, we had to support the currencies of Rial, US Dollar, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Euro, and UAE Dirham. For each currency, we should have a text display/text entry section that displays the equivalent of the amount in that currency, and next to it, the flag of the country that represents that currency should be displayed. In this program, we had to enter a number in the field related to each currency, and as soon as that number changed, its equivalent in other currencies had to be calculated and displayed. For example, if the number 10 was entered in front of Euro, the equivalent of 10 Euros in other currencies should be calculated and displayed in front of other currencies. Also, for the conversion rate of currencies to each other, we used their conversion rate on the first day of December 2022 in our program.

## [Homework 5](https://github.com/amirmohammadraei/android-playground/tree/main/HW5)


The purpose of this program was to practice how to call web services and display their results. In this program, we want to write a weather program. In this application, we had to display a list of provinces and cities so that the user could choose the desired city. It should also be possible to detect the user's current location automatically. After specifying the location by the user, we should get the weather forecast for the next 5 days and display it to the user. We should have used the following service to get the weather forecast (as well as to convert the city name to geographic coordinates). [https://openweathermap.org/forecast5](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)

Also, we should have used the appropriate icon for weather forecasting. In addition, on the page, the name of the desired place and the time of receiving the information should also be displayed. In the city and province list, we should have at least 5 provinces and at least 5 cities for each province.
